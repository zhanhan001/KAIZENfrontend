# Kaizen Frontend by Nori Furikake
## Introduction
The Kaizen Frontend uses a "SOFT UI Dashboard" template as a skeleton framework, kindly provided by Creative Tim under the MIT License. It is based on the Material UI and all relevant codes have been labelled accordingly with their original authors. 

## Running the Project
In order to run Kaizen's Frontend, you will need to run the following commands sequentially.
> npm install

> npm start

Please allow a few minutes for the installation process, and a few seconds for the project initialisation. You should run the frontend in conjunction with the backend â€” otherwise, you should expect missing data, components and "proxy errors" on the terminal.
